# BMS-v2

Created a platform that will keep track of the books you are reading, that you have already read and the books that you want to read in future.

Technologies and Concepts Used:

1)JAVA 

2)HTML 

3)CSS 

4)SERVLET 

5)JSP 

6)Session Tracking 

7)DATABASE (My SQL)

You can login as an individual in the plaform and keep your own track records.

This is an updated version of BMS v1. 
It includes the option for Add, Delete Records from the database and the pages are modified too.
